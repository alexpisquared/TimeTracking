#Some Notes
2020-12-10 - Beware of the missing WPF.dll error (in .Net 4.8 version): it is really annoying!!! Porting to .Net 5.0 then...
2020-12-10 - Porting complete
2022-12-17 - Adjusted for Botsford (no timesheet folder opening)
2023-01-27 - Done: change scheduler to use published ver (still using the Release folder)
2024-03-23 - Phasing out old shared libs in favor of new ones (StandardLib)
